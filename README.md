### Hi there, I'm Sarah 👋

I’m a creative thinker and aspiring junior software developer, opening communication through my newly acquired coding skills and illustration. I use my drawings to engage the emotions and code to connect with people. I am looking for impactful projects where my artistic mind and desire to learn can make a difference.

About me :
- 📚 self learning + hybrid Bootcamp: Nov'21 cohort [Makers Academy](/https://makers.tech/)
- 💭 Some people say I am a dreamer, but I am more of an out of the box thinker
- 🌱 currently training: Ruby/Rails, JavaScript
- 💚 people, diagramming and that 'all tests passing' message
- 🏂 Snowboard enthusiast, mindful dog-sitter, occasional gamer
